# ESP32-MUSIC-PLAYER
SD-Card, Webradio, Bluetooth music player based on an ESP32 Wrover module

This is an MP3 player, Web-radio player, Bluetooth player, and simple waveform generator, based on an ESP32 WROVER module. The output can be either a line-out connection or an on-board 2 x 3W @ 4 ohms power ampifier. The output type can be chosen by mounting matching module(s).

This design is derived from my project "AM/FM-modulator-with-ESP32-module" (https://github.com/Gloeidraad/AMFM-modulator-with-ESP32-module). 

The PCB design has been made with KiCad 8.0.
